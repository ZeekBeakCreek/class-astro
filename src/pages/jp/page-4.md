React components use _props_ to communicate with each other. Every parent component can pass some information to its child components by giving them props. Props might remind you of HTML attributes, but you can pass any JavaScript value through them, including objects, arrays, and functions.

## Familiar props

Props are the information that you pass to a JSX tag. For example, `className`, `src`, `alt`, `width`, and `height` are some of the props you can pass to an `<img>:`

```jsx
function Avatar() {
  return (
    <img
      className="avatar"
      src="https://i.imgur.com/1bX5QH6.jpg"
      alt="Lin Lanying"
      width={100}
      height={100}
    />
  );
}

export default function Profile() {
  return <Avatar />;
}
```

## Passing props to a component

In this code, the Profile component isn’t passing any props to its child component, Avatar

```jsx
export default function Profile() {
  return <Avatar />;
}
```

You can give Avatar some props in two steps.

### Step 1: Pass props to the child component

First, pass some props to `Avatar`. For example, let’s pass two props: `person` (an object), and `size` (a number):

```jsx
export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <Avatar person={{ name: "Lin Lanying", imageId: "1bX5QH6" }} size={100} />
  );
}
```

Now you can read these props inside the `Avatar` component.

### Step 2: Read props inside the child component

You can read these props by listing their names `person, size` separated by the commas inside `({` and `})` directly after `function Avatar`. This lets you use them inside the `Avatar` code, like you would with a variable.

```jsx
function Avatar({ person, size }) {
  // person and size are available here
}
```

Add some logic to Avatar that uses the person and size props for rendering, and you’re done.

Now you can configure `Avatar` to render in many different ways with different props. Try tweaking the values!

```jsx
import { getImageUrl } from "./utils.js";

function Avatar({ person, size }) {
  return (
    <img
      className="avatar"
      src={getImageUrl(person)}
      alt={person.name}
      width={size}
      height={size}
    />
  );
}

export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Avatar
        size={100}
        person={{
          name: "Katsuko Saruhashi",
          imageId: "YfeOqp2",
        }}
      />
      <Avatar
        size={80}
        person={{
          name: "Aklilu Lemma",
          imageId: "OKS67lh",
        }}
      />
      <Avatar
        size={50}
        person={{
          name: "Lin Lanying",
          imageId: "1bX5QH6",
        }}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Props let you think about parent and child components independently. For example, you can change the person or the `size` props inside `Profile` without having to think about how `Avatar` uses them. Similarly, you can change how the `Avatar` uses these props, without looking at the `Profile`.

You can think of props like “knobs” that you can adjust. They serve the same role as arguments serve for functions—in fact, props are the only argument to your component! React component functions accept a single argument, a `props` object:

```jsx
function Avatar(props) {
  let person = props.person;
  let size = props.size;
  // ...
}
```
Usually you don’t need the whole props object itself, so you destructure it into individual props.

## Forwarding props with the JSX spread syntax 

Sometimes, passing props gets very repetitive:

```jsx
function Profile({ person, size, isSepia, thickBorder }) {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      <Avatar
        person={person}
        size={size}
        isSepia={isSepia}
        thickBorder={thickBorder}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```
There’s nothing wrong with repetitive code—it can be more legible. But at times you may value conciseness. Some components forward all of their props to their children, like how this `Profile` does with `Avatar`. Because they don’t use any of their props directly, it can make sense to use a more concise “spread” syntax:

```jsx
function Profile(props) {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      <Avatar {...props} />
    </div>
  );
}
```
This forwards all of Profile’s props to the Avatar without listing each of their names.

Use spread syntax with restraint. If you’re using it in every other component, something is wrong. Often, it indicates that you should split your components and pass children as JSX. More on that next!
